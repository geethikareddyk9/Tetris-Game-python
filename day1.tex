\section{Description}
\begin{frame}{Description}
Tetris is a video game developed in 1984. The game has a simple goal of destroying lines of block before it reaches the top.The line is made up of a square block.



\vskip 1cm
\begin{block}{Rules}
The goal is to drop blocks, called tetrominoes, down into a playing field to make lines.
The Tetris game requires players to strategically rotate, move, and drop a procession of Tetriminos that fall into the rectangular Matrix at increasing speeds.
Players attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without empty space, but if a verical line is formed the game is over.
